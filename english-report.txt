This laboratory is thanks to the INE course to be able to obtain the elearn eJPT certification
security

In this lab called nessus, I have to perform almost every step during a penetration test
but without reaching the exploitation phase, this document is to write what I think during the
test, I will also upload tests, results, etc to my github!

The tasks that I must do are:

- Find the target on the net
- Identify the role in the network of said objective
- Configure nessus and run a scan
- Analyze and export the results
- Explode the target (optional)


--------------------------------
FIND THE TARGET
--------------------------------

To do this I will use the ping sweeping technique which basically consists of sending ICMP packets
to the range of a network.

My IP is 192.168.99.70/24, I use fping and nmap with the -sn option, I will also export the results

The IP addresses I found are:

192.168.99.50
192.168.99.70

Based on the fping results there are only TWO hosts, I will use nmap and also check it manually

Nmap also found only two hosts!

Using ping -c 1 [IP], I will check the operating system, I do this thanks to the TTL, if it is equal to 64 it is
a Linux but if it is equal to 128 it is Windows.

192.168.99.50 is equal to 128, therefore it is a WIndows
192.168.99.70 is equal to 64, therefore it is a Linux

---------------------------------
OPERATING SYSTEM
---------------------------------

In this phase I am already a little advanced, they are running windows and linux, but I will use nmap to try
find out more precisely

Nmap does not return any accurate information to me.

The command I used:

nmap -O 192.168.99.50,70

---------------------------------
PORT SCAN
---------------------------------

With this stage I will obtain the services and versions of the same running in said IP addresses

I will use the command: nmap -sS -sV -A --min-rate 5000

-sS for a SYN scan
-sV to get the versions
-A get versions, OS, run nmap scripts
--min-rate to send 5000 packets per second

I didn't get much but I will use -p- to scan all ports

I have my suspicions that the host 192.168.99.70 has a firewall protecting it!

My machine results 192.168.99.50 tell me that the operating system is: Windows XP

And for the address 192.168.99.70 it is Linux 2.6.X

Although I did not identify the version of the service, so IF it is protected by a firewall

Thanks to this I realize that the IP 192.168.99.50 is a client and NOT a server, since it does not count
with services like FTP or SSH and even NGIX or Apache.

---------------------------------
SCAN WITH NESSUS
---------------------------------

Well for this I will create a new policy focused mainly on Windows

Policy:

In this option disable some options, the port scan was with TCP and in terms of plugins
use only the ones that have to do with Windows.

I will export and analyze the results to try to exploit the vulnerabilities

---------------------------------
VULNERABILITY SCAN
---------------------------------

Once I finish the scan I realize that there are 4 CRITICAL vulnerabilities, but the ones that
caught my attention were:

- MS08-067
- MS09-001

Since both allow remote execution!

In addition to the fact that the smb service has vulnerabilities that as an attacker allow me to collect even more
information about this and this would make intrusion even easier for me.

----------------------------------
CONCLUSION
----------------------------------
This laboratory helps me understand many things, the importance of the information that we can
gather on a system, very useful techniques, the importance of reports and tests, but this
It is only the beginning, I will continue with the course and then I will try to exploit the machine!
